## Pre-configured users 

The following accounts were created for testing purposes. They will also be used for the demonstration of our project.

| Name     | Role         | Email                     | Password |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Liu Cong | Donor        | donor1@gmail.com | password |
| Edmund   | Donor        | donor2@gmail.com | password |
| Hud      | Beneficiary  | beneficiary1@gmail.com | password |
| Dasmond  | Beneficiary  | beneficiary2@gmail.com | password |
| nill     | Admin        | admin1@gmail.com | password |
| nill     | Admin        | admin1@gmail.com | password |


## Usage

1. Create an account as a donor, beneficiary or admin. 
For admin account, your email has to be whitelisted by another admin before you are able to sign up as an admin.

2. Post donations (Donors): Add new donation items with details like food type, quantity, and consume by.

3. Request donations (Beneficiaries): Browse available donations and request items that are needed.

4. Admin management: View and mange all users and donations as well as whitelisting of new admins. 


## API Documentations

The FoodHero application has custom-built API endpoints to handle the main backend functionality. The API routes can be found in the ```/app/api``` directory. 
One example is the adminList API :
| Method | Endpoint               | Description                                         |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/adminList`        | Add an approved adminâ€™s email                       |
| GET    | `/api/adminList`        | Retrieve a list of approved admins                  |
| DELETE | `/api/adminList`        | Remove an approved admin account                    |

Please refer to the [API Docs](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17561519/API.Documentation.pdf) for each specific API route in this directory.

## APP Design

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48e9f6dc-d841-4d64-a297-a59b8bfba0c2)

### Frontend
The frontend of this application is built with Next.js, which allows us to create both static and dynamic pages seamlessly. The frontend architecture includes reusable components and server-rendered pages for optimal performance and SEO.
1. ```/pages``` represents unqiue route in the application. For example, ```pages/user/profile.js``` loads the user profile page.
2. Reusable components in the ```/components``` directory help maintain clean an modular structure. Such compoenets include cards, buttons and forms.
3. Static Site Generation is utilized for pages such as About and FAQ as they dont change frequently.

### Backend

Managed entirely through ```/app/api```. It is a standalone backend endpoint.
For detailed documentaion please refer to [API Documentation](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17561849/API.Documentation.pdf)

NextAuth.js is used to handle user authentication, including role based access control.


## Design patterns 

1. Singelton pattern
   - Ensures only one MongoDB connection instance is created across API routes.

2. Observer pattern
   - Used to trigger notifications when a new donation is created 

## SOLID Principles

 * Single Responsibility Principle
   Seperate packages are created, each with distinct responsibilities. Each class witiin each package handle particular
   logic groups.
<img width="214" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c52c07a-a71c-4429-ac6a-c4ee8ee37d23">


 * Open-Closed Principle
   Prop-driven approach aligns with OCP as the components can be extended with new data or behaviours without changing
   the internal structure.
<img width="573" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8de7c63f-2fcd-4220-8193-ef65cfa01281">


 * Interface Segregration Principle
   Numerous small and specific interfaces are used. 
<img width="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc06549a-c8c1-4c81-8033-83783976cc3d">

 * Dependency Inversion Principle
   High and low level modules depend on abstractions through the use of interfaces. Here, ```beneficiaryDashboardClient ```is passing the ```request``` object as a prop to ```beneficiaryCard```.

## Learn More
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
